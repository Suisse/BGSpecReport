\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to simplify the process of claiming expenses. The current process for making expense claims is often cumbersome and time consuming. 
An American Express study showed that depending on business complexities, and practices and procedures in place, companies spend on average US\$36.46 up to as high as US\$75.91 to process a single expense report.\cite{Expense2010}
