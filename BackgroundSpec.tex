\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to simplify the process of claiming expenses. The current process for making expense claims is often cumbersome and time consuming. 
An American Express \cite{Expense2010} study showed that depending on business complexities, and practices and procedures in place, companies spend on average US\$36.46 to process a single expense report. An Expense system that enables the user to complete an expense claim simply and efficiently, minimising the cost, of both time and money, involved is needed.

It is proposed to take advantage of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to capture the data of a receipt. This will be achieved by 
taking a photograph of the receipt using a mobile device. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Photograph the receipt
	\item Process by OCR
	\item Automatic String matching
	\item User confirm matches
	\item Export expense claim
\end{enumerate}
